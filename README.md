# Alternative Language Project - NIM

**Language and Version**: I chose **Nim version 1.6.0** for this project. Nim offers the performance of C with the readability of Python, ideal for efficient systems programming with an easy development process.

## Why Nim?

I picked Nim due to its compatibility with C, C++ and JavaScript, which allows for flexible integration with various systems. Nim also provides clean syntax which helps simplify code. The idea that I could use one semi-pythonic language that can be converted into 3 other ones intrigued me. That was the main reason I chose this language.

## Nim Features in Action

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Nim supports object-oriented principles. I used these to define a `Cell` type that encapsulates properties of cell phones.

- **File Handling**: Using Nim's `os` and `streams` modules, I efficiently read and processed CSV files, handling large volumes of data seamlessly.

- **Control Structures**: Nim's conditional statements, loops, and assignment statements were crucial for implementing the logic required for data analysis.

- **Functions and Exception Handling**: Nimâ€™s function definitions (`proc`) and exception handling mechanisms (`try`, `except`) allowed me to write robust, reusable code components and handle errors effectively during data transformations.

## Libraries Used

1. **`tables`**: This library was invaluable for creating and managing hash tables, which I used for data aggregation tasks like calculating average weights and counting features.

2. **`strutils` and `strformat`**: Essential for string manipulation, these libraries helped me clean, split, and format strings effectively, facilitating CSV file parsing and output preparation.

3. **`unittest`**: This framework supported my unit testing efforts, ensuring each function worked as expected, crucial for maintaining reliable data transformations.

## Project Outcomes and Analysis

- **Heaviest Phones by OEM**: HP turned out to have the highest average weight for phone bodies, indicating a trend towards more robust phone designs.

- **Launch Discrepancies**: Several models, such as Motorola's One Hyper and Xiaomi's Mi Mix Alpha, were announced one year and released the next, pointing to industry trends in delayed releases.

- **Feature Sensor Analysis**: I discovered that 432 phones in our dataset featured only one sensor, indicating a segment of simpler, possibly more cost-effective phones.

- **Most Active Launch Years Post-1999**: The year 2019 saw the most phone launches, highlighting a peak year in mobile technology development and market dynamics.

These insights showcase Nim's robust capabilities for data processing, and I learned a lot from doing this assignment.
